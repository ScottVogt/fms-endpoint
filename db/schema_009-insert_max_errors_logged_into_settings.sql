INSERT INTO `config_settings` VALUES('max_errors_logged', '10', '<p>The most recent Open311 errors are logged to the database, which is especially useful if you are using FMS-endpoint to test an Open311 client. Use this setting to control how many are saved (older ones are purged automatically when a new error is logged). Suggested values:</p><ul><li>0 &ndash; no errors are logged (good for production sites maybe?)</li><li>10 &ndash; just keep the last ten</li><li>99999 &ndash; a big number if you really want to save them all (maybe to purge manually)</li></ul>');
